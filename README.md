#Modal Windows

This is an element which is used on most websites (eg. Cookies).
By clicking on a specific btn, the corresponding modal is display, together with an overlay around it, blurring out the background around the modal.
The user can close the modal by clicking esc or selecting x or clicking on the overlay.

As soon as I learn bubbling and DOM traversing I will implement this functionality with those tools, to improve performance when scaling this program up.

I would love to hear input from programmers whether my current solution is an efficient approach for the problem.
